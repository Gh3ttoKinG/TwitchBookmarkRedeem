# TwitchBookmarkRedeem
Redeems a Twitch action with a single click in your bookmark


Change the "ReedemText" to the name of the Redeem (it doesn't need to be the full name)

Change the "RedeemCostNumber" to the maximum cost. If it's empty then it always redeems is. If it contains a number then it only redeems it when it is the exact cost or less. (good for when it's a discounted Redeem for a short period of time)

Add it as a bookmark and spam click it on your favourite (or least favourite ðŸ˜‰) streamer!
